    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
        <li>CSS decribes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><b><s>Css is not neccesary</s><span class="bgc"> CSS saves a lot of work.</b></span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
        <li><u><i>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</i></u></li>
    </ol>
    <h2 style="color: orange;"><i>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i></h2>
    <ul>
    <span class="sty">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However, <span class="bgc"><b> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</b></span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul></span>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and itâ€™s used by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
